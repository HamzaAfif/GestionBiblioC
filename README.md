# Library Management System

This **Library Management System** is a foundational project developed in **C**, designed to simulate and streamline operations in a library. The system allows administrators and users to manage books, members, and borrowing processes efficiently. It introduced key concepts of file handling, modular programming, and debugging.

## Features

- **Book Management**:
  - Add, modify, and delete book records stored in text files.
- **Member Management**:
  - Handle subscriber data with unique IDs, names, and other details.
- **Borrowing System**:
  - Enable borrowing, returning, and tracking books.
- **Search and Reservations**:
  - Search for books by title and reserve unavailable ones.
- **Statistics**:
  - Rank users based on activity scores using insertion sort.

## Technical Details

### Languages and Tools
- **Programming Language**: C
- **File Handling**: Text files for persistent data storage
- **Algorithms**: 
  - Sorting (insertion sort and bubble sort) for ranking users
- **Data Structures**:
  - Structs for managing books and users
- **Debugging**:
  - Console-based testing and step-by-step tracing

### Modules
The program is divided into the following modules:
1. **Books**: Management of book inventory.
2. **Members**: Tracking subscriber information.
3. **Borrowing**: Handling borrowing and return operations.
4. **Statistics**: Ranking users and generating reports.

### Prerequisites
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic knowledge of C programming


Lessons Learned
The importance of modular and structured programming.
Using file handling to implement persistent data storage.
Understanding and comparing sorting algorithm efficiencies.
Debugging techniques for ensuring program reliability.
